			<p>Meshu was started in 2012 by Rachel Binx and Sha Hwang. They were two design technologists working in San Francisco, and wanted to explore making a physical product. Both were avid fans of travel and maps, and Meshu came out of the combination of their interests.</p>
			<p>Over the years Meshu has expanded beyond the initial jewelry line, Facet. There have now been five different lines offered on the site; Radial, Arc, Orbit, and Grid. Each line explores a different dataset or a different way of representing geodata.</p>

			<p>Special thanks to <a href="http://about.me/nadyalev">Nadya Lev</a> for her gorgeous photography, and to Erin Murphy for her design work. Meshu would not be where it is today without <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tessaquarium/">Tess Aquarium</a>, who ran fulfillment for several years.</p>
