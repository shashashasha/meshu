	<h2>Sha Hwang</h2>
	<p>Sha is a super-cute dude who excels at life. He works as a design technologist at Trulia, where he is a key member of the visualization and mapping team. When not rocking out with code, he can be found enjoying Mission restuarants and listening to hipster music.</p>

	<h2>Rachel Binx</h2>
	<p>Rachel sports a remarkably similar skillset to Sha, which is why this site is 92% written in Javascript! She also goes by the title of design technologist, working at the ever-lovely design firm Stamen. She jokingly refers to Meshu as her startup, which makes Sha laugh.</p>
