    Thanks! We've received your <b>{{ order.get_display_name }}</b> order. What happens now is we'll review your meshu, process it, and send it off to the fabricator. Once they send your meshu back to us ({{ order.get_processing_time }}) we finish it, package it, and send it on your way!. We'll also email you updates as your meshu is made.
    <br /><br />
    Also, please review your meshu here: <a href="https://meshu.io{% shorturl meshu %}"><b>https://meshu.io{% shorturl meshu %}</b></a>. If you see any missing or misaligned points feel free to edit your meshu and let us know so that we get everything right!
    <br /><br />
    Best,
    <br />
